Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the uni-
verse, wings to the mind, flight to the imagina-
tion, and charm and gaiety to life and to every-
thing” - Plato. Music is one of the most power-
ful forces which lets us communicate, feel and

heal. Subtle nuances in tone, pitch and other
features in a song is what differentiates how one
perceives it. Hence, it is important to categorize
music into different genres.
The music industry in our opinion is a highly
closed environment where new and upcoming
artists find it really difficult to get their music
noticed and it takes them years to come up with

their first ‘hit’ song. With this project we are try-
ing to democratize the industry and give power

back to the people who actually create the mu-
sic. Hence the onus to create good music and

music that the audience is actually interested
in, goes back to the creators instead of falling

on people who are barely involved in the trans-
action that happens between music producers

and music consumers.


Motivation:

A constant in the lives of humans since the dawn of time has been Music; people have been trying (and mostly failing) to create music for the longest time. And for as long as music has existed, creators have been taken advantage of and with the surge of Capitalism, creators have been trying for the longest time to try and predict which of their songs would be hits. Previously they would take the help of so called 'Music Gurus' and Producres who would 'know' how to formulate music that would be consumed like hot cakes by the masses! And more recently this has shifted to Music labels and aggregators like Spotify and Amazon Music who claim to help creators. But it has been established that most of these Labels and Aggregators exploit the creators a lot and take huge cuts from the actual revenue that the music makes. Also, these services focus more on whether the music made money based on the resources spent and thus a lot of intangibles come into question - Marketing, etc.. 

Thus we felt like it was important to give the power of music creation back to the creators instead of letting people who are looking at it only from the business stand-point. Our approach was to create a one stop shop for Creators to get all the insights they would need to create their next hit!

How would we do that?:

1. (understand their music) - 

	(a) take songs that have already been produced by the creator and extract the Spectral and Harmonic features for the music samples using LibRosa.
	
	(b) next we would use these features to find the out which genre the music actually is from (being a subjective field, genre classification done for any labelled data may not be the correct genre due to a variety of reasons - one genre is pushed by the production house, people resonate more with some genres, etc.

	(c) then we would use the same features and compare with our models - whether it would be a hit or not. Each genre has a specific model set based on certain features that predicts whether it should have been a hit or not.


2. Once the user gets these results they would have a good idea if their music should have been a hit in an ideal situation without considering the intangibles we discussed earlier. So they can understand what exactly needs to change for their next track.

3. Finally we want to create a Neural Network that would essentially create musical features which would make the music produced by the user a hit according to the analysis we have done in our model. (Future work)
